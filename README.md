# Toronto Bike Share Web Map
This is an interactive map visualization of the spatial analysis results from my projects [Spatial patterns of seasonal ridership, built environment and social demographics: A taxonomy of Bike Share Toronto stations](https://github.com/zehuiyin/cluster_analysis_toronto_bikeshare) and [Travel speed and routes of the bike-share system: An analysis of Bike Share Toronto](https://github.com/zehuiyin/travel_speed_and_routes_toronto_bikeshare).

You can access the map through this [link](https://zehuiyin.github.io/Toronto_Bike_Share_Web_Map/).
